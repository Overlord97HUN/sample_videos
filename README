To use the sample_creator.py, you have to first create a video of the checkerboard.
The video format in this case have to be .avi and saved as checkerboard.avi in /sample_videos folder.
Then you can can change the number of samples by increasing or decreasing the sampe time inside the code.
The results will be saved in a directory called "sample_images_checkerboard" in .jpg format.
